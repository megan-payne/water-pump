# Water Pump data mining competition

This is the code that I am writing as part of a competition to build a model to predict the functionality of water pumps in Tanzania. The data is provided by Taarifa and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water. It is community-provided data. 


# Supervised learning 

This is a supervised learning project with a training and test data set. 

The possible outcome labels are functional, non functional, and functional needs repair. The training dataset has 2 files, training_set.csv, which contains the predictive variables, and training_labels.csv, which is a list of the outcome variables for the training subjects. 

The submission file is the outcome label of the classification (functional, non functional, or functional needs repair), as well as the ID number of the site for test data. The test and training data sets were split by Driven Data. 

The competition can be found at DrivenData.org:
